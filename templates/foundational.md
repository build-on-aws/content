All frontmatter must be in [syntactically correct YAML](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/).

- `title` - the title of your post in quotes, less than 100 characters i.e. "What Happens When You Type a URL Into Your Browser" - Please put this inside double-quotes
- `description` - a description of your post used to surface a short description on the site and for SEO, less than 250 characters - Please put this inside double-quotes
- `tags` - help readers discover posts on the same topics. Use `kebab-case`.
- `authorGithubAlias` - your GitHub username
- `authorName` - how you want your name to display for the author credit of this post
- `date` - date this post is published in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. This does not effect when your post goes live and is purely for display purposes.

## <Title of Section 1>

For the rest of the content piece, split it into logical sections that each cover a specific aspect of the topic. Where appropriate, link to other content, e.g. other foundational pieces, essentials pages, decision trees, or even tutorials if it makes sense.
