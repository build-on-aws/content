# Content Review Check-List

Ready to submit your content for publication? Review this checklist to make sure your content is ready. Taking care of these items before submitting your content will speed up the time to review.

## Step 1: Write your piece, paying attention to:

- [ ] **Purpose**: Every blog post should describe a common situation, present a problem, and offer a solution. Without a common situation, the problem is too niche; without a problem, there’s no need for a solution; without a solution, there’s no value to the post. Clearly articulate all three key components at the start of your piece.
- [ ] **Clarity**: Prioritize clarity and simplicity over a distinctive voice. Short sentences are best. Use headers to introduce sections and to enable the reader to scan the content.
- [ ] **Style:** Style should be conversational, educational, and opinionated. It should NOT be sales-y.
    - [ ] Is there a clear audience for this piece? Will your blog be useful to that audience?
    - [ ] Does your writing sound like it was written by a human?
    - [ ]  Does the reader feel like they are being marketed or sold to?
    - [ ]  Would the reader naturally search for this content?
    - [ ] Is your writing helpful to the reader — and is the core problem solved in the best way?
    - [ ] Does this content inspire the reader to learn, build, or experiment (even if it’s not on AWS!)?
    - [ ]  Will the reader want to share this content with their network?
    - [ ] Are opinions backed up with sound reasoning and evidence?
- [ ] **Syntax**: All content should follow [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). 
- [ ] **Depth**: Blog posts should be at least 500 words in length, and they should sufficiently address the topic in the title and description.

## Step 2: Once you have finished writing the post, check each of the following:

- [ ] **Errors**: Correct typos, grammatical mistakes, and misspellings.
- [ ] **Titles**: Titles should be succinct, prioritizing action words (what is the reader *doing*) and keywords.
- [ ] **Image formats**: Images should not exceed 2Mb in size. They should be stored in the ./images/ subdirectory of the post, in jpg, png, webp, svg, or gif formats.
- [ ] **Image quality**: Images should be clear and helpful. They should NOT be text-only, and they must include descriptive alt-text. If images don’t work, the AWS editor will suggest alternatives.
- [ ] **Image copyright:** Author has permission to use the images. If you are unsure whether you have permission or the open-source license extends to your use of the image, work with the AWS editor to determine this or to find alternatives.
- [ ] **Personally Identifiable Information:** Posts do not contain personally identifiable information.
- [ ] **Code samples**: Code samples should be presented succinctly in a [Markdown code block](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#code-blocks-1) (with language for syntax highlighting).
- [ ] **Keywords**: In the URL, page title, meta description, first sentence, and headings, the most important keywords should be present and appropriately used. In the meta description, include a call to action.
- [ ] **Tags:** Tags in a post are limited to 5, using the `kebab-case` convention. All tags will be reviewed before publication and will be aligned with existing tags to eliminate duplicates or multiple spellings.
- [ ] **Publication date:** Update the `date` field in the frontmatter to be the anticipated publication date.
- [ ] **Internal links**: In the copy itself, links to other Build On or external content should be anchored to text that describes the linked content. Content linked should be helpful, hands-on resources, not sign-up links or product landing pages.
- [ ] **Product and service names:** The first use of AWS service names can be the shortened version of the service name paired with “AWS” or “Amazon”. Subsequent uses can omit “AWS” or “Amazon”. As an example, “Amazon S3” would come first, followed by “S3.” An AWS editor will verify the correct use during review.
- [ ] **Product and service descriptions:** Product and service descriptions are in your own words, using technical language or a conversational style that resonates with builders.

## Step 3: Before publishing, check to make sure the post adheres to the legal rules:

- [ ] **License:** Ensure you agreed to [license](/LICENSE) in the pull request body and acknowledges ownership or permission to use content including images.
- [ ] **Open Source Code of Conduct**: Ensure that content adheres to the [Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct).
