### Locking Down Unused Regions*
![Enable or disable regions](_img/enable-disable-regions.png_)


Prior to 2019, new regions simply 'appeared' in an AWS account and the accout user could create resources immediately.  That behavior was changed to an opt-in model.  For new AWS Regions, you will opt in to enable your account to operate in those Regions. This makes it easier for you to select the regions where you can create and manage AWS resources. You can use IAM permissions policies to control which IAM principals (users and roles) can perform these actions.

## Identity and Access*


### Securing the root user*
1. Use IAM users for day-to-day access to your account, even if you're the only person accessing it.
2. Eliminate the use of root access keys. Instead, rotate them to IAM access keys, and then delete the root access keys.
3. Use an [MFA device](_https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_configure-api-require.html_) for the root user of your account.
