In this episode we will be focusing on Terraform. We have selected some of the top viewed questions in the AWS Collective and built code and demos around the best answers to those questions!

We would love [your feedback](https://www.pulse.aws/survey/FCUOXLAQ) and suggestions of which questions to look at in next episodes!

## What is the Collective?

Users who join the [AWS Stack Overflow Collective](https://stackoverflow.com/collectives/aws) will find curated, centralized community resources to help them more easily discover the most up-to-date answers including those recommended or written by AWS subject matter experts, technical articles such as how-to guides, and Bulletins for upcoming events and releases.

Members can keep tabs on where they rank on the leaderboard and be promoted to Recognized Member status based on their contributions. By bringing knowledge and users together, the AWS Collective will help the community continue to learn, share, and grow.
