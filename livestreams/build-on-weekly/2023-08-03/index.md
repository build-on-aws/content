"Did you ever want to build your own recommendation engine powered by machine learning? A way to properly create recommendations for your customers? Well you came to the right show ü•≥ In this PART 1 episode, Piyali and Darko look at the first steps it takes to do this.

Today we manage to discuss the reasoning *why* would you need a recommendation engine. We ingest and clean up some data. We get to learn about **pandas** (no, not those üêº), and converting your data into numeric values so it can be trained. Make sure to follow us for future PART 2 and PART 3 of this adventure, where we will actually train the Machine Learning Model, and deploy it as an API Endpoint, and yes have a front end for it as well. Make sure to show up **every Thursday at 9AM Pacific** as we **Build** (more) **On** AWS üòÖ

Oh yeah, and if you wish to follow along at home, Piyali was amazing and she wrote a whole blog post on this same topic. You can check it out [here](https://community.aws/tutorials/recommendation-engine-full-stack).
