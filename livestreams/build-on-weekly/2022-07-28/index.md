## Weekly Builds - AWS CLI & CDK Up and Running

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4snUom0mEY

Today on Weekly build, we install and configure the AWS CLI and AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) on Windows, Linux and Mac OS.

### AWS CLI:

*‚ö†Ô∏è Do NOTE: We are installing version 2.7.1 in this example. The version may be different by the time you read this!*

Here are the steps needed to install the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-version.html) on:

- Linux
    - You must be able to extract or "unzip" the downloaded package. If your operating system doesn't have the built-in¬†`unzip`¬†command, use an equivalent.
    - The AWS CLI version 2 uses¬†`glibc`,¬†`groff`, and¬†`less`. These are included by default in most major distributions of Linux.
    - We support the AWS CLI version 2 on 64-bit versions of recent distributions of CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu, Amazon Linux 1, Amazon Linux 2 and Linux ARM.
    - Because AWS doesn't maintain third-party repositories, we can‚Äôt guarantee that they contain the latest version of the AWS CLI.
    ```bash
    curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64-2.7.1.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
    unzip awscliv2.zip
    sudo ./aws/install
    ```
    
- Mac
    - You know which release of the AWS CLI version 2 you'd like to install. For a list of versions, see the¬†[AWS CLI version 2 changelog](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/blob/v2/CHANGELOG.rst)¬†on¬†*GitHub*.
    - We support the AWS CLI version 2 on Apple-supported versions of 64-bit macOS.
    - Because AWS doesn't maintain third-party repositories, we can‚Äôt guarantee that they contain the latest version of the AWS CLI.
    
    ```bash
    curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2-2.7.1.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
    sudo installer -pkg AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /
    ```
    
- Windows
    - You know which release of the AWS CLI version 2 you'd like to install. For a list of versions, see the¬†[AWS CLI version 2 changelog](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/blob/v2/CHANGELOG.rst)¬†on¬†*GitHub*.
    - A 64-bit version of Windows XP or later.
    - Admin rights to install software
    
    ```bash
    msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2-2.7.1.msi
    ```
