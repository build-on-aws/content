Today on Deployed Weekly we kick off with a warm welcome to the 500 new Community Builders we welcomed globally before taking a look at Cloud Glance, a tool that helps you navigate multiple AWS Environments with ease. Next up is the first Amazon CodeWhisperer workshop we‚Äôve encountered while we share some of our thoughts about tools that help you to generate code. We then highlight Amazon Cloudfront‚Äôs added HTTP/3 QUIC support. Finally, we shared a link to open roles here at AWS DevRel if you‚Äôd like to come work with like us!
