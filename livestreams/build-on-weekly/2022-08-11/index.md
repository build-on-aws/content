Welcome to episode 5 of Build On Weekly! ü•≥

Today [Jacquie](https://twitter.com/devopsjacquie) and [Darko](https://twitter.com/darkosubotica), discuss a few things around Containers and Hybrid environments. That means running your applications On-Premises AND in the cloud. In today's episode watch Darko as he sweats trying to troubleshoot a real time demo. üòÖ

We will be posting here, on [BuildOn.aws](/livestreams/build-on-weekly), to share **show notes, links, socials, code, and any other things mentioned** during the live stream with you! üöÄ

## Deployed Weekly

Today on deployed weekly we take another peek at Lambda functions and .NET. What are the best strategies when running the two together. We talk about a interesting Open Source tool that helps you prototype and productionize (is that even a word?) ML Pipelines. Another wonderful CLI tool out there, for al the CLI and Tracing fans. A wrap up on the AWS Storage Day that happened the day before and finally an amazing interview/podcast over on Lex Friedman‚Äôs channel - with the best programmer in the world John Carmack.

Today we will be talking about a few things, you all should know about:

1. Containers and the reason we use them.
2. Hybrid environments.
3. Darko‚Äôs Macbook ECS cluster

### Containers

Just a quick word this. Containers, or more precisely Containerization is application-level virtualization. The reason for this is so that software can be packaged up in these containers and run in isolated ‚Äúuser spaces‚Äù called containers!

***But why?***

Because we want to be able to package the entire running environment of a piece of software into a single bundle and run it on many different platform. Be that the cloud or in that laptop right in front of you! *Magic*!

On today's episode Jacquie and Darko talk about containers, why you should use them, how to orchestrate them and what do they have to do with a Hybrid environment.

Later in the episode, check out how Darko struggles to add an external "server" to his AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) [cluster](https://macluster.rup12.net/). Plenty of fun times were had while troubleshooting.
