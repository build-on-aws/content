üëã Hello friends and welcome to Build On Weekly, a [Twitch show](https://www.twitch.tv/aws) where we build something together every week while answering questions from our favourite people - you! We'll build anything that helps you solve problems: whether it's Open Source or AWS, from operators, developers, data or security specialists to anyone in between. Join us every Thursday at 9am PT to learn live with us through hands on keyboard coding and stay for the lively conversations with expert guests.
