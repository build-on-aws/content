## ****Creating an Intelligent Software Development World Where any Developer can Develop Fast with Zero Bugs****

Guest: Dedy Kredo

With the ever-growing demand for software solutions and the need to improve development velocity, developers face immense challenges developing faster and with higher quality.
On top of that, due to the rise of AI-empowered assistants, developers are creating even more code, faster. The code generated by AI might not be entirely aligned with the developer‚Äôs full intent, and hence it might contain bugs that could get overlooked by developers. This growing trend compounds the need for code level testing.

In this session, Dedy Kredo, Co-founder and CPO at CodiumAI shows you how their AI coding assistant helps developers reach zero bugs. CodiumAI provides an IDE extension that automates unit/component test generation, identifies and fixes bugs in the code, and suggests enhancements to the code in areas such as best practices, modularity, vulnerability mitigation, performance, etc.

## 0 to Auth in an Hour or Less with Descope

Guest: Doron Sharon, Co-Founder, Descope

Passwordless authentication may seem complex, but it is simple to add it to any app using the right tool. There are multiple alternatives that are much better than passwords to identify and authenticate your users ‚Äì including Social Logins, Passkeys, Magic Links, One-Time Passwords, SAML SSO, and Authenticator Apps.

In this session, we enhance a full-stack JS application (Node.js backend + React frontend) to authenticate users with OAuth (social login) and One Time Password (email) using Descope in minutes, then, we show how simple is to add new capabilities, such as Passkeys, to the login journey.

They also show how you can add passwordless auth to your Amazon Cognito login by setting Descope as an OIDC provider.

Watch the recording and learn how to add secure, frictionless login experiences to any app with a few lines of code!
