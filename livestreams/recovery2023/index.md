![re:Cover event banner](./images/recover_banner.png)

Join us for a comprehensive 3-day live stream designed to re:Cap and re:Cover from last weeks re:Invent 2023. The purpose of this live stream event is to demonstrate to you how to use and implement the latest launches and features in a practical manner. Each day will consist of a 4-5 hour long live stream, dedicated to achieving a specific goal by utilizing the new features. 

We will be sipping on a coffee in a comfortable sweater with some relaxing lo-fi music playing the background, as we are joined by Amazonians and Community members to help us build stuff in the cloud. Remmeber, we are ALL re:Covering (pun intended) from the event last week.

More information, the agenda, speakers, and everything else ... coming real soon! Only on **[https://twitch.tv/aws](https://twitch.tv/aws)**
