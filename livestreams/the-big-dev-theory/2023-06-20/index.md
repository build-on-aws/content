In this episode of The Big Dev Theory on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1851832780), Matúš Čongrády [Stacktape](https://www.stacktape.com/) with CEO and Founder explores the process of deploying a full stack application to AWS using Stacktape and securing it with Stacktape's built-in security features. We focus on two key aspects of application security: adding authentication using Cognito user pool and implementing a firewall using AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall).


Each episode, we chat with AWS partners and bring experts with specialized knowledge in various areas of technology to provide informative and engaging live streams that help developers stay up-to-date with the latest trends and tools.
