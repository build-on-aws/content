In this episode of The Big Dev Theory on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1918449852), we are joined by Nereu Oliveira Senior Software Engineer at LoginID at [LoginID](https://loginid.io/)


In this enlightening session, developers will delve into the world of low-code/no-code integration, where identity verification becomes an integral part of the customer onboarding journey. With the rising importance of identity in modern applications and services, this session will demonstrate how developers can effortlessly enhance the customer experience through a hosted identity verification button. This hosted identity verification button serves as a powerful combination of identity verification and robust authentication, streamlining the onboarding process. Moreover, LoginID will introduce an innovative 'Pass' feature, allowing customers to create and manage identity attributes within their digital profiles. They can then authorize the sharing of these attributes with trusted verifiers, enhancing trust and security in the digital realm.

Notably, this session will also explore the seamless integration of AWS Amplify, a low-code/no-code framework, into the process. Developers will learn how to harness the capabilities of AWS Amplify to simplify and expedite the integration of identity verification and strong authentication, further enhancing the overall customer experience. Key takeaways from this session will empower developers to build verified identities seamlessly integrated with FIDO-Passkeys for strong authentication. Participants will gain practical insights, discover best practices, and receive hands-on demonstrations, ensuring they are well-prepared to implement this innovative approach effectively.

By the end of this session, developers will be equipped with the tools and knowledge to create a smoother onboarding experience, bolstering trust and security, and embracing the future of identity verification in the digital age. Join us on this journey to unlock the potential of identity and FIDO-Passkeys, powered by AWS Amplify, for a seamless customer onboarding process.

Each episode, we chat with AWS partners and bring experts with specialized knowledge in various areas of technology to provide informative and engaging live streams that help developers stay up-to-date with the latest trends and tools.
