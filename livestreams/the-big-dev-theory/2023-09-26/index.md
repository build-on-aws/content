In this episode of The Big Dev Theory on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1935703774), we are joined by Toni de la Fuente, Founder of Prowler OSS, Lead of [Prowler Pro](https://prowler.pro/) (Verica) and David Melamed, Co-Founder & CTO at [JIT](https://www.jit.io/), AWS Community Builder

Building on the serverless app built in the previous episode, we will now dive even deeper into your cloud deployments. We will take a look at an app hosted in AWS, explore the complexities of cloud security by seeing the power of Prowler in action, a robust tool for detecting common (and less common) cloud misconfigurations. We'll also demonstrate methods to harness the power of cloud-native security services to tackle additional security challenges that constantly arise in dynamic cloud environments. From deployment to continuous protection, this talk will equip you with practical insights to fortify your cloud-hosted applications. Join us to uncover the secrets of securing your AWS infrastructure and leveraging cloud-native capabilities to elevate your security posture in the ever-evolving world of cloud computing.


Each episode, we chat with AWS partners and bring experts with specialized knowledge in various areas of technology to provide informative and engaging live streams that help developers stay up-to-date with the latest trends and tools.
