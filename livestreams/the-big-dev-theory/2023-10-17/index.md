In this episode of The Big Dev Theory on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1953959698), we are joined by Brandy Smith, SR. Solutions Engineer, [Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/) We continue our journey with Grafana. We show you how the AWS integration for Grafana Cloud makes it easy to centralize your observability data. Access all of your metrics, logs, and traces in a central place on our LGTM stack and interact with it using common query languages, like PromQL. Join us to learn more about: How you can visualize and perform cross-region, cross account observability of an AWS environment with a single query. Configure and pick the exact metrics and logs to collect and store in Grafana Cloud – No need to scrape extra metrics that aren’t useful to you!

[Grafana integrations](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/monitor-infrastructure/integrations) bundle Grafana Agent, tailored Grafana dashboards, and alerting defaults for common observability targets like Linux hosts, Kubernetes clusters, and Nginx servers. With Grafana integrations, you can get a pre-configured Prometheus and Grafana-based observability stack up and running in minutes.

[Integration partners](https://grafana.com/partnerships/integrations): Integrate your technology with Grafana and instantly connect your users (and their data) to premium dashboarding, alerting, and monitoring features.

[CloudWatch metrics integration for Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/monitor-infrastructure/integrations/integration-reference/integration-cloudwatch) The CloudWatch integration allows you to scrape AWS CloudWatch metrics without installing the Grafana agent. You can create multiple configurations called “scrape jobs” to separate concerns. Please note that we can only discover metrics for AWS resources that have tags applied to them. For more information, see the [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html?sc_channel=el&sc_campaign=livestreams&sc_content=the-big-dev-theory&sc_geo=mult&sc_country=mult&sc_outcome=acq).

Each episode, we chat with AWS partners and bring experts with specialized knowledge in various areas of technology to provide informative and engaging live streams that help developers stay up-to-date with the latest trends and tools.
