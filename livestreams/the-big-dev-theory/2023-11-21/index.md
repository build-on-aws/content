In this episode of The Big Dev Theory on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1984193690) Trong Tran, developer and member of the AWS development team at [Mendix](https://www.mendix.com/) and Nicolas Kunz Vega, Ecosystem Solutions Consultant at Mendix will take you through the journey of their day-to-day work where theyâ€™ll show you how they at Mendix build their AWS connectors. Using Amazon Comprehend we make our Mendix Claims template even smarter and extract more relevant data out of customer submissions. This template already uses the Amazon Textract AI to get customer input from hand written documents, but the next step is to make the life of claims managers even easier by providing an intelligent and efficient way of getting the right data in front of them in a Mendix application.
