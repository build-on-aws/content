Join a live demonstration of an unsecured serverless app, highlighting the most common vulnerabilities –– leveraging popular community resources, like the OWASP Serverless Top 10. Learn how to detect security issues just-in-time before hitting production with essential security tools including SAST, SCA, IaC, DAST and more. We'll provide an overview of some of our favorite best of breed open-source security tools as we dissect their pros and cons, empowering you to make informed choices and select the right ones for different stacks and requirements (as defined in the different security frameworks covered in our previous episode). Discover which criteria matter when selecting OSS tools to ensure you maximize developer adoption and make your projects thrive in a secure environment. Join us to master the art of elevating security without disrupting your engineering velocity.
