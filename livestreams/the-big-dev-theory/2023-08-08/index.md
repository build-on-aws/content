In this episode of The Big Dev Theory on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1896908029), we are joined by Babu Srinivasan Senior Partner Solutions Architect at MongoDB from [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

Prepare to be captivated by an enlightening episode of The Big Dev Theory that promises to unlock the realms of cutting-edge technology. In this exclusive presentation, MongoDB and AWS converge to embark on a journey that immerses you into the realm of Fraud Detection, seamlessly weaving together the innovative capabilities of MongoDB Atlas and Amazon SageMaker Canvas. At the heart of this exploration lies the persistent challenge faced by existing fraud detection systems – the shackles of relying on outdated data. In a rapidly shifting landscape where innovation knows no bounds, placing your trust solely in historical information is comparable to navigating the labyrinth of fraud with one hand restrained. As cybercriminals continue to refine their tactics with unparalleled agility, the imperative for financial institutions to outpace these threats becomes even more pronounced. Unveil the solution that paves the way for robust fraud detection – a dynamic amalgamation of MongoDB's data prowess and Amazon SageMaker Canvas's machine learning finesse. Join us as we delve into the intricacies of creating an environment where real-time data insights stand as sentinels against emerging fraud strategies. This episode is your ticket to staying ahead of the curve, unraveling the mysteries of cutting-edge technology, and arming yourself against the ever-adapting world of cyber threats.

Each episode, we chat with AWS partners and bring experts with specialized knowledge in various areas of technology to provide informative and engaging live streams that help developers stay up-to-date with the latest trends and tools.
