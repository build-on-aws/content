In this episode of The Big Dev Theory on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1906303935), we are joined by Nereu Oliveira Senior Software Engineer at LoginID at [LoginID](https://loginid.io/)


In this session, developers will learn how to seamlessly integrate FIDO-Passkeys into applications or services, creating a passwordless experience for customers via two core integration paths. This session will provide a comprehensive understanding of these integration paths. The first path will cover the technology, protocols, and security measures behind FIDO-Passkeys, enabling developers to confidently implement this authentication method. They'll also explore potential use cases and scenarios for enhancing both security and user convenience. The second path will guide developers in integrating FIDO-Passkeys into existing infrastructure, ensuring compatibility with current authentication mechanisms. This approach facilitates a smooth transition to a passwordless future, addressing compatibility and onboarding challenges.

The session will include practical demonstrations, code samples, and case studies, allowing developers to gain hands-on experience. Interactive discussions will provide opportunities for expert guidance from seasoned professionals in authentication and security. By the end of this session, developers will be well-prepared to leverage FIDO-Passkeys, transforming their applications or services into passwordless solutions that enhance user experience and strengthen security in the digital landscape. Join us in embracing the future with FIDO-Passkeys.

Each episode, we chat with AWS partners and bring experts with specialized knowledge in various areas of technology to provide informative and engaging live streams that help developers stay up-to-date with the latest trends and tools.
