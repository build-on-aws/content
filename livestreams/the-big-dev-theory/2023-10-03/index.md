In this episode of The Big Dev Theory on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1942293847), we are joined by Brandy Smith, SR. Solutions Engineer, [Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/)

Many people know Grafana for the visualization layer - but did you know Grafana Labs has built the world's first open & composable observability stack — and it's designed for monitoring hybrid-cloud, container, and microservices environments - amongst other things! Have you used Grafana to build a dashboard? Have you experimented with your first dashboard and are looking to build your first production dashboard? Or perhaps you’re looking to give your existing dashboards that well-deserved makeover finally? Join us to learn more.

[Grafana integrations](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/monitor-infrastructure/integrations) bundle Grafana Agent, tailored Grafana dashboards, and alerting defaults for common observability targets like Linux hosts, Kubernetes clusters, and Nginx servers. With Grafana integrations, you can get a pre-configured Prometheus and Grafana-based observability stack up and running in minutes.

[Integration partners](https://grafana.com/partnerships/integrations): Integrate your technology with Grafana and instantly connect your users (and their data) to premium dashboarding, alerting, and monitoring features.

[CloudWatch metrics integration for Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/monitor-infrastructure/integrations/integration-reference/integration-cloudwatch) The CloudWatch integration allows you to scrape AWS CloudWatch metrics without installing the Grafana agent. You can create multiple configurations called “scrape jobs” to separate concerns. Please note that we can only discover metrics for AWS resources that have tags applied to them. For more information, see the [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html?sc_channel=el&sc_campaign=livestreams&sc_content=the-big-dev-theory&sc_geo=mult&sc_country=mult&sc_outcome=acq).

Each episode, we chat with AWS partners and bring experts with specialized knowledge in various areas of technology to provide informative and engaging live streams that help developers stay up-to-date with the latest trends and tools.
