In this episode of The Big Dev Theory on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1911734242), we are joined by Yuriy Ackermann Head of all FIDO things and Product Manager at[LoginID](https://loginid.io/)


In this session, developers will gain insights into seamlessly integrating FIDO-Passkeys for robust authentication within AWS's core IAM service, Cognito. This integration not only enhances security but also eliminates the reliance on traditional passwords, revolutionizing the way customer accounts are protected. The primary focus of this session will be on enabling developers to activate FIDO-Passwordless on top of Cognito. By doing so, they will explore the steps and best practices to implement this advanced authentication method effectively. Throughout the session, participants can expect to delve into the technical intricacies that underlie the integration, understanding the inner workings of Cognito and how FIDO-Passkeys fit seamlessly into this IAM ecosystem. Real-world use cases and scenarios will be explored, shedding light on the transformative potential of this integration, particularly in enhancing customer account security.

Key takeaways from this session will include a deep understanding of how to activate FIDO-Passwordless within Cognito, along with practical guidance, demonstrations, and hands-on examples to ensure developers are well-prepared to implement this cutting-edge authentication method effectively. By the session's end, developers will be empowered to secure customer accounts with enhanced FIDO-Passkey authentication while bidding farewell to traditional passwords. This forward-looking approach not only boosts security but also simplifies the user experience. Join us in this journey toward a passwordless future with Cognito and FIDO-Passwordless.

Each episode, we chat with AWS partners and bring experts with specialized knowledge in various areas of technology to provide informative and engaging live streams that help developers stay up-to-date with the latest trends and tools.
