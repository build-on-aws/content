In this episode of The Big Dev Theory on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1777986027), we explore how to build a modern web app with AWS integration, logging & monitoring, and environment variables, with Lee Robinson VP of Developer Experience from [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). We provide an overview of the workflow from setup to deployment, discuss the advantages of using CDK to integrate with AWS services, and explain how to use logging & monitoring. Our workflow provides a comprehensive & reliable way to develop, deploy & maintain a web app with AWS integration & any front end framework.


Each episode, we chat with AWS partners and bring experts with specialized knowledge in various areas of technology to provide informative and engaging live streams that help developers stay up-to-date with the latest trends and tools.
