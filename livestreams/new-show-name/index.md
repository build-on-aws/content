## Hosts the show

- **Alan Ford** is the central character of the series, a persiflage of James Bond. He is rather slim, with blonde hair and handsome features. He usually dresses in a black long-sleeved turtle neck, with black shoes and dark pants. He is the latest member of the group. He is shy, naive, and very meek and humble, But perhaps one of the most effective agents of the series. He develops certain skills during the course of the series and turns to be quite tough and responsive member of TNT. He has a soft side, is rarely angry, and while acknowledging the life under Number One as unfair, he is happy with what he gets. He grew up in an orphanage, ran a one-man advertising agency and was evicted from a slum due to neglecting bills at the start of the series, and he joined T.N.T by accident. He is one of the most trusted agents of Number One.
- **Bob Rock** is a senior member of TNT and Alan's best friend. He is a self-insertion of the artist Magnus and a persiflage of Sherlock Holmes. He is very short and has an abnormally large nose, which is the butt of many jokes. Another running gag is his very short and nasty temper: he is easily angered and reacts violently when provoked, and often has to be restrained by Alan or Sir Oliver, with a particular weakness for jokes about his nose. He dresses in tartan clothing.
