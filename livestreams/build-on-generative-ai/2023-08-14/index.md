Welcome to **season 2** of Build On Generative AI! üéâ Yes, we have heard you, and we will continue with our show, every Monday at 9AM PST/Noon EST/18h CET üëè Today, Emily and Darko are kicking off the new season by talking about Large Language Models (duh!), and more specifically about [LLama2](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/llama2) the latest LLM coming out of Meta!

Emily and Darko look into the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.09288.pdf) behind LLama2, and evaluate the model. Lastly, as is tradition - we go ahead and actually deploy the model using [SageMaker Jumpstart](https://go.aws/464j9qb) and see it live in action.
