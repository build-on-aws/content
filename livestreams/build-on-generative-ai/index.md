You may have heard about Generative AI and you want to see it in action. You want to know if there is substance behind the hype. Maybe you want to see if there is anything real behind the claims, and you wanna see how far it can go. Well then - WELCOME üëã Welcome to the Build on Generative AI show. Your favorite weekly [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/aws) show, about all things Generative AI. Every week we look at new technical and scientific patterns on AWS, inviting guest speakers to demo their work and show us how they built something new to improve the state of Generative AI.

## Hosts of the show

Every week you can join in the conversation both on or off the air with your hosts, Emily and Darko:

- Emily Webber is a Principal Machine Learning Specialist Solutions Architect and keynote speaker at Amazon Web Services, where she has lead the development of countless solutions and features on Amazon SageMaker. She has guided and mentored hundreds of teams, developers, and customers in their machine learning journey on AWS. She specializes in large-scale distributed training in vision, language, generative AI, and is active in the scientific communities in these areas. She hosts YouTube and Twitch series on the topic, regularly speaks at re:Invent, writes many blog posts, and leads workshops in this domain worldwide. Make sure to check out her [book](bit.ly/dist-train-book).
- Darko Mesaro≈° (–î–∞—Ä–∫–æ –ú–µ—Å–∞—Ä–æ—à), Senior Developer Advocate: Seattle, WA based resident retro hardware aficionado who loves yelling into the camera about the cloud while he learns, breaks and builds it. If you could summon him with one word it would be: Commodore 64. Talk with him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/darkosubotica) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darko-mesaros/).

If you have any questions, comments, or ideas, **reach out** to us. Feel free to send us an email at: [build-on-generative-ai@amazon.com](mailto:build-on-generative-ai@amazon.com)
