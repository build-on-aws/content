Today's show has *nothing* to do with Cooking but a lot to do with Generative AI. In episode 6 of season 2, Emily and Darko are joined by Matthias and Sean for a wonderful discussion on **Llama Recipes**. So what are Llama Recipes? Well this is just a [github repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama-recipes), that is a companion to the [Llama 2 model](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama), and provides examples on how to quickly get started with fine-tuning for domain adaptation and how run inference for those fine-tuned models.

To get started with these recipes you can check out the quickstart notebook [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama-recipes/blob/main/examples/quickstart.ipynb), which can run even on a single GPU, for example on a *g5.xlarge* [EC2 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g5/?sc_channel=el&sc_campaign=livestreams&sc_content=build_on_weekly&sc_geo=mult&sc_country=mult&sc_outcome=acq). ðŸ¥³
