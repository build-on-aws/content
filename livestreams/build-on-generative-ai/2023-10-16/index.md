On Today's episode, David is back! He is joining Darko to discuss alignment in Generative AI. From discussions about doing math with words, to the important topic of how bias in introduced in LLMs. The goal of today's discussion is how can you find a LLM that aligns with your goals, and David shows us by using the Free Dolly training set from DataBricks. As David said: "We are dropping the concept of *what is best*, but rather we are looking how close are we aligned to our goals".
