I'm very excited to announce that [Amazon Bedrock](hhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-service.html/?sc_channel=el&sc_campaign=genaiwave&sc_content=amazon-bedrock-integrating-foundation-models-into-your-code&sc_geo=mult&sc_country=mult&sc_outcome=acq) is now generally available! The official news blog post can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-bedrock-is-now-generally-available-build-and-scale-generative-ai-applications-with-foundation-models/?sc_channel=el&sc_campaign=genaiwave&sc_content=amazon-bedrock-integrating-foundation-models-into-your-code&sc_geo=mult&sc_country=mult&sc_outcome=acq), which contains details and some additional exciting service announcements.

Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that makes foundation models (FMs) from Amazon and leading AI startups available through an API, so you can choose from various FMs to find the model that's best suited for your use case.

## Access Amazon Bedrock via the Python SDK (Boto3)

In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab1mbj0acDo), AWS Senior Developer Advocate, and generative AI specialist [Mike Chambers](https://linkedin.com/in/mikegchambers) steps through how to use Boto3, the Python SDK for AWS, to make text generations with models such as Anthropic Claude and A121 Labs Jurassic.

To follow along you will need the [latest Boto3 library](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html?sc_channel=el&sc_campaign=genaiwave&sc_content=amazon-bedrock-integrating-foundation-models-into-your-code&sc_geo=mult&sc_country=mult&sc_outcome=acq), an AWS account, and IAM permissions to call the Amazon Bedrock service.

We have lots more posts and videos coming your way that will cover all aspects of Amazon Bedrock. So make sure to bookmark this [Space](/generative-ai) and subscribe to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@awsdevelopers).

Happy building!
