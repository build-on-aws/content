I'm very excited to announce that [Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-service.html/?sc_channel=el&sc_campaign=genaiwave&sc_content=amazon-bedrock-integrating-foundation-models-into-your-code&sc_geo=mult&sc_country=mult&sc_outcome=acq) is now generally available! The official news blog post can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-bedrock-is-now-generally-available-build-and-scale-generative-ai-applications-with-foundation-models/?sc_channel=el&sc_campaign=genaiwave&sc_content=amazon-bedrock-integrating-foundation-models-into-your-code&sc_geo=mult&sc_country=mult&sc_outcome=acq), which contains details and some additional exciting service announcements.

Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that makes foundation models (FMs) from Amazon and leading AI startups available through an API, so you can choose from various FMs to find the model that's best suited for your use case.

## Access Amazon Bedrock via the Python SDK (Boto3)

Discover Amazon Bedrock and learn how to integrate generative AI models from leading AI startups and Amazon into your applications:

In the video below, I step through how to use Boto3, the Python SDK for AWS, to make text generations with models such as Anthropic Claude and A121 Labs Jurassic.

To follow along you will need the [latest Boto3 library](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html?sc_channel=el&sc_campaign=genaiwave&sc_content=amazon-bedrock-integrating-foundation-models-into-your-code&sc_geo=mult&sc_country=mult&sc_outcome=acq), an AWS account, and IAM permissions to call the Amazon Bedrock service.

There are more posts and videos coming your way that will cover all aspects of Amazon Bedrock. So make sure to bookmark this [Space](/generative-ai), subscribe to the [AWS Developers YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@awsdevelopers), and [follow me on LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mikegchambers) if you want to geek out with me on generative AI or Amazon Bedrock.

Happy building!
