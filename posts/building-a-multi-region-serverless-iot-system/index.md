In this post we will take a look at how to build a multi-region serverless IoT system. We will dig deep into concepts like how to replicate certificates across regions, and how to setup a DNS record for device connection. All in an event-driven and serverless way.

## Why create a multi-region setup ?

There are many reasons why we create multi-region systems on AWS. It can be compliance requirements, resiliency, or latency requirements. In an IoT system, we often have small devices with limited bandwidth which makes latency requirements even more important. With a large system with a global footprint a multi-region solution help us solve that challenge. However, building a multi-region IoT system comes with challenges of its own.


In a multi-region IoT system we don't want our IoT devices to be aware of what or how many AWS Regions we are running in. This should be totally transparent to the device, it should only connect to iot.example.com. For this to work, we must register our IoT Things, Policies, and certificates in all regions. Therefore, we will be able to replicate all of this information across all Regions, despite what Region the device connect to.

We will look at the steps needed to perform this replication in an efficient way. What services to use, and what the setup looks like.

## Architectural overview

What we are building in this post is an architecture that will span two AWS Regions, with devices connecting to the closest region using Route53. AWS StepFunctions state-machine will act on incoming events from IoT Core and carry out the needed work. Now let's get started and let's get building.

![Image showing the architecture overview.](images/architecture-overview.png)

We will use an [configurable endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-custom-endpoints-configurable.html?sc_channel=el&sc_campaign=resiliencewave&sc_geo=mult&sc_country=mult&sc_outcome=acq&sc_content=building-a-multi-region-serverless-iot-system) with a custom domain: iot.example.com. This will be configured in two regions and we'll use a latency-based record to let devices connect to the Region closest to them. When devices connect for the very first time, the device certificate will be registered in IoT Core, using Just In Time Registration. If a device certificate is successfully registered and activated, it will be stored in an device registry, which is a Global DynamoDB table. By utilizing DynamoDB Streams, the replication of the device certificate can be done in an event-driven way, by utilizing EventBridge Pipes and a custom event-bus. Devices will use certificates issued by a self-signed Root CA. When we authenticate our devices towards AWS IoT Core, we will be using Mutual TLS.

Data from the IoT devices will be stored in a Global DynamoDB table to allow access from both regions. Throughout this blog post we will be using us-west-2 (Oregon) and eu-west-1 (Ireland) region when we build and create resources.

Letâ€™s start off by creating the DynamoDB tables we need.

## Creating device registry and data table

We will create two global DynamoDB tables that will only be deployed to a single Region but configured with a replica in a second Region. We need a way to keep track of the devices that have already been registered, despite which Region it was initially registered in. For this, we will create a Device Inventory table. For testing purposes, we will also create a global DynamoDB table where we can store data coming from the devices.

We will deploy these resources using AWS CloudFormation / [Serverless Application Model (SAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/?sc_channel=el&sc_campaign=resiliencewave&sc_geo=mult&sc_country=mult&sc_outcome=acq&sc_content=building-a-multi-region-serverless-iot-system)

## Creating Certificates

We are going to use a self-signed Root CA when issuing server and device certificates. In a production environment, you should use Root CA signed by a third party trusted source. Our certificate chain will include a Root CA and an Intermediate CA. The Intermediate CA will issue both the server and client certificates. [Read this to learn more about SSL/TLS certificates](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/ssl-certificate/?sc_channel=el&sc_campaign=resiliencewave&sc_geo=mult&sc_country=mult&sc_outcome=acq&sc_content=building-a-multi-region-serverless-iot-system). [Read this to learn more about the process](https://www.golinuxcloud.com/openssl-create-certificate-chain-linux/) that we will be using to create the certificates. We will be using [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) when creating certificates.

We will start by creating the folder structure needed and the files needed to track our certificate creation.

```bash
mkdir -p ./myCA/rootCA/{certs,crl,newcerts,private,csr}
mkdir -p ./myCA/intermediateCA/{certs,crl,newcerts,private,csr}
mkdir -p ./myCA/server/{certs,crl,newcerts,private,csr}
mkdir -p ./myCA/clients/{certs,crl,newcerts,private,csr}

# Needed to keep track of the last serial number that was used to issue a certificate
echo 1000 > ./myCA/rootCA/serial
echo 1000 > ./myCA/intermediateCA/serial

# This is incremented each time a new Certificate Revocation List (CRL) is generated.
echo 0100 > ./myCA/rootCA/crlnumber 
echo 0100 > ./myCA/intermediateCA/crlnumber

# Create index.txt file which is a database of sorts that keeps track of the certificates that have been issued by the CA
touch ./myCA/rootCA/index.txt
touch ./myCA/intermediateCA/index.txt
```

Next, we create the private key and certificate for the Root CA.

```bash
# Root CA:
openssl genrsa -out ./myCA/rootCA/private/ca.key 4096
openssl req -config ./myCA/ca_root.cnf -key ./myCA/rootCA/private/ca.key -new -x509 -days 7300 -sha256 -extensions v3_ca -out ./myCA/rootCA/certs/ca.crt -subj "/C=SE/ST=Scania/L=Malmo/O=MyOrg/OU=/CN=Root CA"
```

With the Root CA created, we can use this to create and sign the Intermediate CA and create a certificate bundle with the Root and Intermediate CA.

```bash
# Intermediate CA:
openssl genrsa -out ./myCA/intermediateCA/private/ca_intermediate.key 4096
openssl req -config ./myCA/ca_intermediate.cnf -key ./myCA/intermediateCA/private/ca_intermediate.key -new -sha256 -out ./myCA/intermediateCA/csr/ca_intermediate.csr -subj "/C=SE/ST=Scania/L=Malmo/O=MyOrg/OU=/CN=Intermediate CA"
openssl ca -config ./myCA/ca_root.cnf -extensions v3_intermediate_ca -days 3650 -notext -md sha256 -in ./myCA/intermediateCA/csr/ca_intermediate.csr -out ./myCA/intermediateCA/certs/ca_intermediate.crt

# Create Certificate Bundle / Certificate Chain.
cat ./myCA/intermediateCA/certs/ca_intermediate.crt ./myCA/rootCA/certs/ca.crt > ./myCA/intermediateCA/certs/ca-chain.crt.pem
```

With the Root CA and Intermediate CA created we can continue to create the server certificate and generate a couple of device certificates as well. The process is very similiar to the one when creating the Intermediate CA. When the server certificate is created, it's very important that the CommonName is set to the server FQDN, in our case iot.example.com.

```bash
# Server Certificate
openssl genrsa -out ./myCA/server/private/iot.example.com.key 2048
openssl req -config ./myCA/ca_intermediate.cnf -key ./myCA/server/private/iot.example.com.key -new -sha256 -out ./myCA/server/csr/iot.example.com.csr -subj "/C=SE/ST=Scania/L=Malmo/O=MyOrg/OU=/CN=iot.example.com"
openssl ca -config ./myCA/ca_intermediate.cnf -extensions server_cert -days 375 -notext -md sha256 -in ./myCA/server/csr/iot.example.com.csr -out ./myCA/server/certs/iot.example.com.crt
```

Finally, we create a set of different client certificates. Here we can create a simple bash script that helps us create the certificate, and copy it to clients folder so we can easily access them. For the client certificates we like the common name to match the Thing name we'll use in IoT Core later.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

NAME=$1

if [ -z "$NAME" ]
then
      echo "You must enter a device name!"
      exit 1
fi

openssl genrsa -out ./myCA/clients/private/$NAME.key 2048
openssl req -config ./myCA/ca_intermediate.cnf -key ./myCA/clients/private/$NAME.key -new -sha256 -out ./myCA/clients/csr/$NAME.csr -subj "/C=SE/ST=Scania/L=Malmo/O=MyOrg/OU=/CN=$NAME"
openssl ca -config ./myCA/ca_intermediate.cnf -extensions usr_cert -days 365 -notext -md sha256 -in ./myCA/clients/csr/$NAME.csr -out ./myCA/clients/certs/$NAME.crt

# For easy access copy the key and cert to a clients folder.
cp ./myCA/clients/certs/$NAME.crt ./clients
cp ./myCA/clients/private/$NAME.key ./clients
```

The configuration files used is the standard [OpenSSL configuration file](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/apps/openssl.cnf) with the absolute path to the keys set.

With all the certificates created, we can continue with everything and setup the IoT Core endpoints. 

## Creating configurable endpoint

The first thing we need to do is import the server certificate to AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). We need three things: the server certificate, the server private key, and the certificate chain we also created earlier.

![Image showing the import of server certificate to ACM.](images/import-server-cert-acm.png)

The import can also be done using the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/?sc_channel=el&sc_campaign=resiliencewave&sc_geo=mult&sc_country=mult&sc_outcome=acq&sc_content=building-a-multi-region-serverless-iot-system).

```bash
aws acm import-certificate --certificate fileb://myCA/server/certs/iot.example.com.crt \
      --certificate-chain fileb://myCA/intermediateCA/certs/ca-chain.cert.pem \
      --private-key fileb://myCA/server/private/iot.example.com.key
```

```text
Note!
The server certificate must be imported in both regions for the setup to work properly.
```

The next step in the process is process is to create the domain configuration and a latency based Route53 record. To prove that we are the rightful owners of the domain name, we also need to create a validation certificate in ACM. To create all of this, we can turn to AWS CloudFormation and SAM. It's assumed that a Hosted Zone for the domain exists in Route53.

We need the IoT Core Endpoint, so we can point the Route53 record to it. There is only one Iot Core endpoint per account and Region. The endpoint can be found under the Settings menu in the IoT Core console.

![Image showing the IoT Core Endpoint setting.](images/iot-core-endpoint.png)

It's also possible to get the endpoint using the `CLI`. We need to get the Data ATS endpoint.

```bash
aws iot describe-endpoint --endpoint-type iot:Data-ATS
```

We will be using the same template through out this blog post and just continue to add resources to it.

To validate the IoT domain configuration, we can navigate to IoT Core console and check the configuration under settings. The domain configuration should look like the images below.

![Image showing the IoT Core domain configuration.](images/iot-core-validate-domain-config.png)

![Image showing the IoT Core domain configuration details.](images/iot-core-validate-domain-config-details.png)

With the endpoint configured, we can move to the next step, activating just in time registration.

## Activate Just In Time Registration

The first time a device connects to IoT Core with a certificate signed by our Intermediate CA, the certificate from the device will be registered in IoT Core. This way we can manufacture our devices, bundle them with certificates but not have them registered in IoT Core. The device will receive an immediate disconnect and then need to reconnect. There needs to be some form of wait logic in the device to allow for the cloud to activate the device in IoT Core before reconnecting. We can add our own validation in this activation step, making sure the device is who it claims to be.

We need to run these steps in both regions, because our devices will connect using the configured DNS `iot.example.com` and will connect to the closest Region.

1. Register our CA certificate in IoT core and turn on auto-registration.
2. Create an IoT Core Rule that will invoke an AWS StepFunction to carry out our activation logic.
3. Replicate our device to the second Region. This step will use an event-driven architecture and react when our device is registered in the primary Region.

To register the CA certificate, we use the `CLI` to do so. We'll register the certificate in `SNI_ONLY` mode. This way the same CA can be registered in several accounts and regions.

```bash
## Register in eu-west-1
aws iot register-ca-certificate --allow-auto-registration  --ca-certificate file://myCA/intermediateCA/certs/ca_intermediate.crt --certificate-mode SNI_ONLY --set-as-active --region eu-west-1

## Register in us-west-2
aws iot register-ca-certificate --allow-auto-registration  --ca-certificate file://myCA/intermediateCA/certs/ca_intermediate.crt --certificate-mode SNI_ONLY --set-as-active --region us-west-2
```

It is also possible to do the registration using the console. Navigate to the IoT Console, and select Security. When using the console the `SNI_ONLY` mode is called `Multi-account`, this is the same as `SNI_ONLY`, the graphical interface just calls it something different. Upload the `ca_intermediate.crt` file, that we created in the steps when creating certificates.

![Image showing the IoT Core domain configuration.](images/register-ca-cert-iot-core.png)

As usual, we can also do this using the `CLI`

To be able to invoke an AWS StepFunction when a certificate is registered, we must enable [IoT Core Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-events.html?sc_channel=el&sc_campaign=resiliencewave&sc_geo=mult&sc_country=mult&sc_outcome=acq&sc_content=building-a-multi-region-serverless-iot-system). These events will be posted onto a reserved AWS topic, `$aws/events/xyz` that we then can create a rule for. The events for registered certificates can ONLY be enabled using the `CLI` as this option is not available in the console. To enable the events, we need to run the commands.

```bash
## Enable in eu-west-1
aws iot update-event-configurations --event-configurations '{"THING":{"Enabled":true},"CERTIFICATE":{"Enabled":true},"CA_CERTIFICATE":{"Enabled":true},"POLICY":{"Enabled":true}}' --region eu-west-1
## Verify
aws iot describe-event-configurations --region eu-west-1

## Enable in us-west-2
aws iot update-event-configurations --event-configurations '{"THING":{"Enabled":true},"CERTIFICATE":{"Enabled":true},"CA_CERTIFICATE":{"Enabled":true},"POLICY":{"Enabled":true}}' --region us-west-2
## Verify
aws iot describe-event-configurations --region us-west-2
```

Once again, we turn to our CloudFormation / SAM template and add some additional resources. To start we'll, create the IoT Policy that we attach to our devices, the IoT Core Rule, and the StepFunction that implements our logic.

## Deep dive JITR logic

The JITR logic includes several steps that need to be coordinated and orchestrated. StepFunctions is an excellent service for this, and we can use the built in error handling to rollback certain steps if we have a failure. We need to fetch information about the registered certificate and read out information from it. We'll check that this is a new device and that it doesn't already exists in our registry of devices. We then create an IoT Thing, attach the registered certificate to that Thing, attach our standard IoT Policy, that we created in pervious part, and then we activate the certificate to allow the device to actually connect to IoT Core. Finally we register the device in our global device registry DynamoDB table.

All but one of the tasks can be completed using the powerful [service and SDK integration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-to-services.html?sc_channel=el&sc_campaign=resiliencewave&sc_geo=mult&sc_country=mult&sc_outcome=acq&sc_content=building-a-multi-region-serverless-iot-system) that exists in StepFunctions. For the task to read out information from the actual certificate, we need to use an AWS Lambda Function. We need to get the name of the thing, and this should match the common name in the certificate.

```python
# Read the CommonName from the certificate PEM
from cryptography import x509
from cryptography.x509.oid import NameOID


def handler(event, context):
    certificatePEM = event["CertificateInfo"]["CertificateDescription"]["CertificatePem"]

    return {"CommonName": read_certificate_data(certificatePEM)}


def read_certificate_data(certificatePem):
    cert = x509.load_pem_x509_certificate(certificatePem.encode("utf-8"))

    subject = cert.subject
    return subject.get_attributes_for_oid(NameOID.COMMON_NAME)[0].value
```

## Replicate device to the second region

When a device has been registered and activated in one Region, we need to copy all of that information to the second Region. This will include the actual device certificate and we need to create the Thing, attach policy and certificate. We do this so our devices then can connect to any of our Regions, creating a multi-region setup with failover possibilities. This part of the system will be event-driven and invoked when a new device is stored in our device inventory. To accomplish this we will use DynamoDB streams, we will use EventBridge Pipes to publish an event to an EventBridge event-bus when there is a new record in the stream. From the event-bus we can invoke a StepFunction that will carry out the work. This StepFunction state-machine will be running in the destination Region, meaning we need to fetch information cross-region from the source Region.

We add some additional resources to our template and deploy this to both Regions.

```

The state-machine is very similar to the one used to register a new device. The main difference is that the device is not written to the device table. We also need to fetch certification data cross-region.

```python
# Read certificate data cross-region
import boto3
import json

from cryptography import x509
from cryptography.x509.oid import NameOID


def handler(event, context):
    certificateId = event["CertificateId"]
    region = event["ThingRegion"]
    certificateData = describe_certificate(certificateId, region)

    certificatePem = certificateData["certificateDescription"]["certificatePem"]
    commonName = read_certificate_data(certificatePem)

    return {"Pem": certificatePem, "CommonName": commonName}


def describe_certificate(certificateId, region):
    client = boto3.client("iot", region_name=region)
    response = client.describe_certificate(certificateId=certificateId)
    return response


def read_certificate_data(certificatePem):
    print(certificatePem)
    cert = x509.load_pem_x509_certificate(certificatePem.encode("utf-8"))

    subject = cert.subject
    return subject.get_attributes_for_oid(NameOID.COMMON_NAME)[0].value
```

With the replication done, we are ready to start testing the solution using our two regions.

## Testing

What we will do during testing is set up an IoT Rule that will invoke a StepFunction state-machine, which will store the incoming data in our global data DynamoDB table.
To imitate devices, we will use EC2 instances, running in the different regions, add use [Eclipse Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) and [mosquitto_pub](https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto_pub-1.html).

First of all, let's create the resources we need, we addon to our CloudFormation template.

Make sure to upload the Root CA certificate, the intermediate CA certificate, the device certificates and private keys, that you have created, to the `CertificateStoreBucket` bucket in both Regions. Since we use our self-signed CA certificate to sign the server certificate we must present this during the connection attempt.

From the EC2 console, let's create an Ubuntu 22.04 instance.

![Image showing the first part of creating an EC2 instance.](images/create-ubuntu-ec2-instance.png)

For network setting use the default VPC and allow SSH access from anywhere.

```text
!!IMPORTANT!! 

This is only for testing purposes using an transient EC2 instance! 
It's not recommended to allow SSH from anywhere on a long running instance!!

!!IMPORTANT!!
```

![Image showing the EC2 instance network settings.](images/create-ec2-instance-network-setting.png)

Under advanced settings, select the Instance Profile, in the Region, that we created using the CloudFormation template.

![Image showing the EC2 instance advanced settings.](images/create-ec2-instance-advanced-setting.png)

Make sure to create an test instance in both Regions.

We can now connect to the instance using Instance Connect from the console.

![Image showing connecting to EC2 instance using instance connect.](images/connect-to-ec2-instance.png)

When connected to the instance install AWS CLI, Mosquitto using `snap`, and download the device certificates from the S3 Bucket.

```bash
## Install AWS CLI
sudo apt update
sudo apt install awscli

## Create a test folder and download certificates
mkdir mqtt-test
cd mqtt-test
aws s3 sync s3://multi-region-iot-certificate-store-eu-west-1 .

## Install Mosquitto
sudo snap install mosquitto
sudo snap connect mosquitto:home snapd:home

```

With this installed with can use `mosquitto_pub` to connect and publish a message. The first time we try to connect the device will receive an immediate disconnect, this since the device certificate is not registered and active.

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h iot.example.com --cafile ./ca.crt --cert ./test_001.crt --key ./test_001.key -p 8883 -q 1 -d -t i/test_001/m -i test_001 -m "{\"message\": \"Hello From Test-001\"}"

## You will see message saying
Client test_001 sending CONNECT
Error: The connection was lost.
```

Navigating to StepFunctions console in our current (primary) test Region, should show at least one invocation of the JITR state-machine with a success.

![Image showing the invocation of the JITR state-machine.](images/jitr-statemachine-success.png)

In our other (replication) Region we should see a successful invocation of the replication state-machine.

![Image showing the invocation of the JITR state-machine.](images/replicate-statemachine-success.png)

Returning to our instance connect session and issuing the command again will now generate a different result.

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h iot.example.com --cafile ./ca.crt --cert ./test_001.crt --key ./test_001.key -p 8883 -q 1 -d -t i/test_001/m -i test_001 -m "{\"message\": \"Hello From Test-001\"}"

## You will see message saying
Client test_001 sending CONNECT
Client test_001 received CONNACK (0)
Client test_001 sending PUBLISH (d0, q1, r0, m1, 'i/test_001/m', ... (32 bytes))
Client test_001 received PUBACK (Mid: 1, RC:0)
Client test_001 sending DISCONNECT
```

Repeat the above using an EC2 instances in both Region. You can imitate the same device from both regions. After sending some data we can navigate to the DynamoDB table, containing our IoT data. Verify what Region the data was written to the table from this is from our test state-machine writing ingress data to the table.

## Conclusion

Creating a multi-region IoT system can be a challenge, with replication of Things and certificates. As shown in this post it can be automated in an event-driven and serverless way that allows our IoT devices to connect and send data to several Regions using FQDN custom endpoint.
