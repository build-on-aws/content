    "We all have heard of teams whose total is more that total sum of its members. This is basically intuition for the superadditive characteristic function game. More accurately we have for each combination of distinct coalitions, if the total payout of the combined coalition is more than or equal the total sum of its coalition members. The distinctness does make sense. Let us consider the case of $\\{C_A=\\{A\\}, C_{AB=}\\{A,B\\}\\}$. There is a hidden double counting of contribution of $A$ so we should account for it. In the case of our example $v(C_A)=100,v(C_B)=80,\\ v(C_{AB})=160;\\ 160=v(C_{A,B}) < v(C_A) + v(C_B) = 180$ does not contradict super additiveness. How about $v(C_{AB})$ and $v(C_C)$ where the two coalitions are distinct? $v(C_{AB}) = 160,\\ v(C_C) = 65, and  v_{ABC}=250;\\ 225 = v(C_{AB}) + v(C_B) \\leq v(C_{ABC}) = 250$ does not contradict superadditiveness.\n",

The case of $\\{A, C\\}$ results in $165 = v(C_A) + v(C_C) > v(C_{AC}) = 140$, therefore the sales example is not a superadditive game. Altering payouts to $v(C_{AC} \\geq 165$ will make the game to be an example of a superadditive game. "

Either we are looking at a single game of total sales in a quarter, or we can break that game to individual games based on each sales. The quarterly games of selling services for this sales team can be split into independent games. It is often done very regularly by splitting annual sales to quarterly sales and rewarding sales them on the basis of their quarterly performance.
