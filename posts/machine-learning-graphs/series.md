This series provides an incremental learning path to Graph neural netwrorks. We begin with why graphs are useful and then provide a theoratical minimum of graph theory that is required to understand GNN terminology. Eventiualy we move to GNNs and developing a Convolutional GNN and application of GNNS to create a knowledge grph. We end the journey with a paper from Amazon Science that uses knowledge graphs to develop drug discovery tool that has a potential to be effective on COVID19 RNA signature.
