Developers those who provide solutions to computer problems, base procedures, program and maintain solutions, they are programmers, but it does not make them experts in everything that is related to code, as is the case of creating ML-dependent function, where it is necessary to be familiar with models and training of algorithms, which is not common knowledge.

There are some ready-to-use APIs that call existing models previously trained to fulfill ML-functions without need for ML knowledge, and additionally keep information shared with it secure. Next, I'm going to tell you about some specific ML API services and four use cases to get you familiar with them and let your imagination run wild.


## How does ready-to-use ML-functions APIs work? Just follow 3 simple steps:

1. Define the input, the location of the object in an Amazon S3 bucket or text.
2. Invoke the API using input.
3. Output in json format.

## Let's take a look at the APIs

In AWS there are several [ML and AI services](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/) that allow you to accelerate their adoption in applications, from those that provide you with infrastructure to train your own models to those are ready to use as pre-trained API calls, let's see some of the seconds:

| API Type | How you can do | Service Name | 
-- | -- | --
 🔎 Analysis of images (.png, .jpg) /videos (.mp4) | <ul> <li> Label detection (predefined or custom) </li>  <li> Image propereties and moderation. </li>  <li> Facial detection, comparasion and analysis. </li>  <li> Face search </li>  <li> People paths. </li>  <li> Personal Protective Equipment </li>  <li> Celebrities recognition.  </li>  <li>Text in image </li>  <li> Inappropriate or offensive content </li></ul> | [Amazon Rekognition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/what-is.html)	|

## Conclusion

Now you learned that you can use AIML as an API call to analyze images and videos, detection and analysis of text in scanned documents, analyze text using NLP to extract sentiment from dominant language and much more. In addition to being able to convert text to speech, and vice versa, and a language translator within reach of an API call.

This is just a small part of what you can create by powering AIML applications within the reach of an API call.
