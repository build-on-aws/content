Developers those who provide solutions to computer problems, base procedures, program and maintain solutions, they are programmers, but it does not make them experts in everything that is related to code, as is the case of creating ML-dependent function, where it is necessary to be familiar with models and training of algorithms, which is not common knowledge.

There are some ready-to-use APIs that call existing models previously trained to fulfill ML-functions without need for ML knowledge, and additionally keep information shared with it secure. Next, I'm going to tell you about some specific ML API services and four use cases to get you familiar with them and let your imagination run wild.


## How does ready-to-use ML-functions APIs work? Just follow 3 simple steps:

1. Define the input, the location of the object in an Amazon S3 bucket or text.
2. Invoke the API using input.
3. Output in json format.

## Let's take a look at the APIs

In AWS there are several [ML and AI services](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/) that allow you to accelerate their adoption in applications, from those that provide you with infrastructure to train your own models to those are ready to use as pre-trained API calls, let's see some of the seconds:

## üöÄ  Use Cases 

Best way to learn programming is by solving problems through code development,  same thing happens when you want to learn how to use a service, you need to use it to learn. These four use cases are real (and made-up) problems that I solved while learning.

- [Create subtitles and translate them into the language you want ‚èØÔ∏è üçø.](https://github.com/build-on-aws/aiml-like-api-in-your-app/blob/main/create-subtitles-and-translate-them-into-the-language-you-want/README.md)

If you are passionate about providing video with tools for others to learn, you want to reach as many people as possible, and language is a barrier that you can remove with this app.

![Create subtitles and translate them into the language you want"](images/create-subtitles-and-translate-s.png)

1. Upload the .mp4 video to an [Amazon s3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/es_es/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingBucket.html).
2. A Lambda Function makes the call to Transcribe API.
3. Subtitles file in the original language are downloaded to S3 Bucket. 
4. A Lambda Function makes the call to Translate API.
5. Subtitles file in the new language is downloaded to S3 Bucket.

- [Detecting entities and sentiment from a document üîé üìÑ.](https://github.com/build-on-aws/aiml-like-api-in-your-app/tree/main/detecting-entities-and-sentiment-from-a-document%20)

There are people who have mountains of papers in their homes, letters from past lovers, medical exams, memories of their children‚Äôs school, banks, etc. What do you think of saving it neatly in the cloud? Try and learn about Textract and Comprehend with this app.

![Detecting entities and sentiment from a document"](images/detecting-entities-and-sentiment.png)

1. Upload the document (PNG, JPG, PDF or TIFF) to an S3 Bucket.
2. A Lambda Function makes the call to Textract API.
3. With the response from Textract, Lambda Function makes the call to Comprehend API. 
4. A Lambda Function makes the call to the Translate API.
5. The response is saved in an S3 bucket.

- [Make Polly Talk ü¶ú](https://github.com/build-on-aws/aiml-like-api-in-your-app/tree/main/make-polly-talk)

I was curious how an Italian speaking Chinese sounded, and since Polly has native voices for each language I created this notebook to play üòÇ.

![Make Polly Talk"](images/make-polly-talk.png)

1. From a Jupyter Notebook make the call to Polly API.
2. Polly stores the result in a S3 bucket.
3. Retrieves the audio.

- [Video content moderation ‚èØÔ∏è üî´ üö¨](https://github.com/build-on-aws/aiml-like-api-in-your-app/tree/main/video-content-moderation)

I¬¥m fan of action movies and wanted to try Rekognition with the trailer of Die Hard 1, so I created this application and wow! each dataframe is pure violence ü´£... I invite you to try it with a trailer of your favorite movie.

![Video content moderation"](images/video-content-moderation.png)

1. Upload the .mp4 video to an [s3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/es_es/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingBucket.html).
2. A Lambda Function makes the call to Rekognition API.
3. Once the video review is finished, a new Lambda Function retrieves the result and stores it in an s3 bucket.

## Conclusion

Now you learned that you can use AIML as an API call to analyze images and videos, detection and analysis of text in scanned documents, analyze text using NLP to extract sentiment from dominant language and much more. In addition to being able to convert text to speech, and vice versa, and a language translator within reach of an API call.

This is just a small part of what you can create by powering AIML applications within the reach of an API call.

Surely you have a real or invented problem that you would like to solve using one of these services and if not I leave these links for you to continue experimenting and learning:
