You've built out the first version of you Flask web app and even containerized it with Docker so your developer teammates can run it locally. Now, it's time to figure out how to deploy this container into the world! You want to have your app deployed whenever you or your teammates push a new feature up to the repo. You also want to make sure that the code you're putting out into the world is high quality and delivers value to your customers right away. To do this, we'll create a simple CI/CD pipeline to deploy our container to infrastructure in the cloud.

![Architecture of our solution](images/automate-your-container-deployments-with-cicd-and-github-actions-architecture.png "Architecture of our solution")

Upon push to the main branch, we'll trigger a GitHub Actions workflow that runs two jobs:
- a test job to run unit tests against our Flask app, and
- a deploy job to create a container image and deploy that to our container infrastructure in the cloud
First, we'll create this infrastructure using the CDK, an infrastructure as code framework that let's us create infrastructure with higher-level programming languages like Python.

We're only deploying one container today, but this solution would work if you're running multiple containerized services.

Let's get started!

### Prerequisites

To work through these examples, you'll need a few bits setup first:
- An AWS account. You can create your account [here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/).
- The CDK installed. You can find instructions for installing the CDK [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html). Note: For the CDK to work, you'll also need to have the AWS CLI installed and configured or setup the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` as environment variables. The instructions above show you how to do both.
