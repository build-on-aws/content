In our last post, [Picturesocial - What’s Kubernetes and why should you care?](posts/picturesocial/02-whats-kubernetes-and-why-should-you-care/), we learned about Kubernetes and why are we using it in Picturesocial. In this post, we are going to learn about infrastructure as a code and specifically how to deploy a Kubernetes cluster using Terraform.

I have been working on IT projects for years and something recurrent in my experience has been how developers work together with sysadmins, esspecially when the application pushes changes to the infrastructure and the way things are done traditionally. The application has to be adapted to the infrastructure or the infrastructure has to be adapted to the application. What happens if those infrastructure changes mean you can’t rollback easily?

In the past, we designed applications knowing that in most of the cases the infrastructure was static and that we had to deal with the constraints as something axiomatic and immovable. As we went forward into our path to the cloud, that paradigm started to break with the possibility to have theoretically all the compute we needed at the power of our hands almost immediately. That shift helped create a new set of solutions designed for those new capabilities, one of them was Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

## What is Infrastructure as Code?

When I was at school I liked to write stories for Dungeons and Dragons where the main character had to make choices that were selected by the reader, and depending on the choice, you would go through a very specific set of scenarios that can potentially be a very long and complex story or the end. If you made a choice, it wouldn't be possible to return to a point in the past and you were forced to go further. This is how things happen with infrastructure. You start with assumptions that make you choose and most of the changes are irreversible unless you know everything that happened from the beginning. That also means that keeping versioning of the infrastructure configuration in conjunction with the application would be possible but very difficult and that’s where Infrastructure as Code comes to action.

Infrastructure as Code lets you define your infrastructure and configuration as developers create code and is composed by configuration files. Those configuration files are interpreted and transformed in infrastructure and configuration on your hybrid or public cloud environment. IaC lets you keep versions of every change for rollout and rollback. You can even create tests to understand what those changes mean before applying it. 

For Picturesocial, I decided to use Hashicorp Terraform for our Infrastructure as Code definition, because I have been using it for years and I feel sure that I can scale my architecture and infrastructure without spending much time learning a new tool. But also, there are other great tools out there like AWS CDK, AWS CloudFormation, Pulumi, Ansible, Chef, Puppet, etc. that can also help you. The best option is the one that makes you feel comfortable and productive.

## What is Hashicorp Terraform?

Terraform is an IaC tool created by Hashicorp that helps you define a complete infrastructure in a way that you can version and reuse. It uses Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL) for its structure. All Terraform configuration files must be saved with `.tf` extension. Some of the basic definitions are:

* **Providers** This is where you tell Terraform that you are using a specific [cloud provider](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers). For example, if you want to deploy infrastructure to AWS, you can define the provider like the example below. Just note that the version of the provider is optional. If you don’t specify it, it will use the latest as default.
  ```json
  terraform {
    required_providers {
      aws = {
        source  = "hashicorp/aws"
        version = ">= 3.20.0"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

* **Resources** This is where you actually define the infrastructure. You use the resources as pieces of infrastructure like: instances, networks, storage, etc. A resource needs two declarative parameters: 1) resource type and 2) resource id. For example, below we are defining an EC2 instance with a specific AMI and an instance type t2.micro.
  ```json
  resource "aws_instance" "web" {
    ami           = "ami-a1b2c3d4"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
  }
  ```

* **Variables**
  * Input: These are the variables that you use to ask the users for information before applying any change. These kind of variables are parameters that you have to specify at the command line.
    ```json
    variable "project_code" {
      type = string
    }

    variable "availability_zone" {
      type    = list(string)
      default = ["us-east-1a"]
    }
    ```

  * Output: These are variables that will return information from execution, like final repository name, cluster id, etc.
    ```json
    `output "ec2_ip" { value = aws_instance.server.private_ip }`
    ```

  * Locals: These are variables that you set on your script and work as constants you can reference at any part of the script. The example below will create a common tag that will concat the values of variables `project_code` and `environment`.
    ```json
    locals {
      project_code = "pso"
      environment  = "dev"
    }
    common_tags = {
      project_name = "pe-${local.project_code}-${local.environment}01"
    }
    ```

* **Modules** We use modules to group different resources that are used together. That way instead of having huge Terraform templates with lots of resources, we can standardize scenarios into one single object, like: Every EKS cluster needs a VPC with six subnets, two Elastic Load Balancers, two worker groups with at least three EC2 instances each, etc. Instead of creating all those resources per cluster, we can create one module and reuse it for simplification.
  ```json
  module "aws-vpc" {
    source = "./mods/aws-vpc"
    base_cidr_block = "11.0.0.0/16"
  }
  ```

I like to think of Terraform as a four step IaC tool (even when you have more options). We are going to use four basic commands that will apply for all our projects. Those steps need to be applied in the following order:

1. `terraform init` Use this command to initialize your terraform project. You only have to run this command once per project.
2. `terraform plan` This command tests what is going to be created, updated or deleted on your Cloud environment before making any actual change. Consider this a testing command.
3. `terraform apply` This command will force you to execute a `terraform plan` first and then you have to explicitly confirm your actions to execute the final changes.
4. `terraform destroy` When you no longer need your environment, you can destroy it completely. This is wonderful for certification environments that are only needed when a new release is coming.

## Deploy a Kubernetes cluster

Now that we know the basics about IaC and Terraform, we are going to deploy an Amazon EKS cluster from scratch!

### Prerequisites

* An [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).
* If you are using Linux or macOS, you can continue to the next bullet point. If you are using Microsoft Windows, I suggest you to use [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
* Install [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).
* Install [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
* Install [AWS CLI 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

Or

If this is your first time working with AWS CLI or you need a refresher on how to set up your credentials, I suggest you follow this [step-by-step guide of how to configure your local AWS environment](https://aws.amazon.com/es/getting-started/guides/setup-environment/). In this same guide, you can also follow steps to configure AWS Cloud9,  as that will be very helpful if you don’t want to install everything from scratch.

### Walk-through

In this walk-through we are going to create an EKS cluster on the us-east-1 region using three availability zones, our own VPC, a worker group with three t2.small instances, and security rules to prevent unrestricted access to our worker group. 

You can follow along with the the code for this demo in the [sample code repo](https://github.com/aws-samples/picture-social-sample). Make sure to select the "ep3" branch.

1. First, we clone our base repo so we have all the terraform files that we are going to use to create this Amazon EKS Cluster.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/picture-social-sample --branch ep3
```

2. Once cloned, let's go to the newly created directory. We are going to make sure we are always inside this directory for the rest of this walk-through so the following commands run smoothly.

```bash
cd picture-social-sample
```

3. Now that we cloned the repo, we are going to explore the files on our branch. We are going to start with `config.tf`. This file will contain the basic configuration for our Terraform project like, default AWS Region, and the name of the cluster that is combined with `picturesocial-` and a random three digit number. We can reference any of these values in every part of the project as we are going to see in the other files.

```
variable "region" {
  default     = "us-east-1"
  description = "Region of AWS"
}

provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
}

data "aws_availability_zones" "available" {}

locals {
  cluster_name = "picturesocial-${random_integer.suffix.result}"
}

resource "random_integer" "suffix" {
  min = 100
  max = 999
}
```

4. The file `vpc.tf` is where we set our network and the availability zones that we are going to use. Don’t panic if you don’t know what a VPC is. Read more about [how to get started with VPCs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-getting-started.html).

```json
module "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "3.2.0"

  name                 = "picturesocial-vpc"
  cidr                 = "10.0.0.0/16"
  azs                  = data.aws_availability_zones.available.names
  private_subnets      = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24", "10.0.3.0/24"]
  public_subnets       = ["10.0.4.0/24", "10.0.5.0/24", "10.0.6.0/24"]
  enable_nat_gateway   = true
  single_nat_gateway   = true
  enable_dns_hostnames = true

  tags = {
    "kubernetes.io/cluster/${local.cluster_name}" = "shared"
  }

  public_subnet_tags = {
    "kubernetes.io/cluster/${local.cluster_name}" = "shared"
    "kubernetes.io/role/elb"                      = "1"
  }

  private_subnet_tags = {
    "kubernetes.io/cluster/${local.cluster_name}" = "shared"
    "kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb"             = "1"
  }
}
```

5. Now that we set the VPC, we are going to set the security groups. The security groups will allow or deny traffic to the EC2 instances of the EKS cluster. Here, we are allowing traffic to the port 22 from selected network segments named cidr_blocks.

```json
resource "aws_security_group" "worker_group_mgmt_one" {
  name_prefix = "worker_group_mgmt_one"
  vpc_id      = module.vpc.vpc_id

  ingress {
    from_port = 22
    to_port   = 22
    protocol  = "tcp"

    cidr_blocks = [
      "10.0.0.0/8",
    ]
  }
}

resource "aws_security_group" "worker_group_mgmt_two" {
  name_prefix = "worker_group_mgmt_two"
  vpc_id      = module.vpc.vpc_id

  ingress {
    from_port = 22
    to_port   = 22
    protocol  = "tcp"

    cidr_blocks = [
      "192.168.0.0/16",
    ]
  }
}

resource "aws_security_group" "all_worker_mgmt" {
  name_prefix = "all_worker_management"
  vpc_id      = module.vpc.vpc_id

  ingress {
    from_port = 22
    to_port   = 22
    protocol  = "tcp"

    cidr_blocks = [
      "10.0.0.0/8",
      "172.16.0.0/12",
      "192.168.0.0/16",
    ]
  }
}
```

6. The file `eks-cluster.tf` uses a public AWS module that we can use to simplify the creation of an EKS cluster. We are going to set the cluster name referencing the variable that we set on our `config.tf` file. We choose our Kubernetes version and then we also reference our VPC and subnets, defined on the `vpc.tf` file.

```json
module "eks" {
  source          = "terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws"
  version         = "17.24.0"
  cluster_name    = local.cluster_name
  cluster_version = "1.20"
  subnets         = module.vpc.private_subnets

  vpc_id = module.vpc.vpc_id

  workers_group_defaults = {
    root_volume_type = "gp2"
  }

  worker_groups = [
    {
      name                          = "group-1"
      instance_type                 = "t2.small"
      additional_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.worker_group_mgmt_one.id]
      asg_desired_capacity          = 3
    },
  ]
}

data "aws_eks_cluster" "cluster" {
  name = module.eks.cluster_id
}

data "aws_eks_cluster_auth" "cluster" {
  name = module.eks.cluster_id
}
```

7. And finally, we are going to check the outputs on the `outputs.tf` file. This is the file that will produce the Kubernetes Config file or kubeconfig. This is the file needed by Kubectl or the Kubernetes REST API to know who you are, if you have access, and if they can trust you. This is one of the most important pieces to get access to the EKS cluster.

```json
output "cluster_id" {
  value       = module.eks.cluster_id
}

output "cluster_endpoint" {
  value       = module.eks.cluster_endpoint
}

output "cluster_security_group_id" {
  value       = module.eks.cluster_security_group_id
}

output "kubectl_config" {
  value       = module.eks.kubeconfig
}

output "config_map_aws_auth" {
  value       = module.eks.config_map_aws_auth
}

output "region" {
  value       = var.region
}

output "cluster_name" {
  value       = local.cluster_name
}
```

8. Now, let’s make sure that we have Terraform correctly installed by running the command below on your favorite terminal. If everything is fine, we should get the version. We are going to need at least Terraform 1.1.7.

```bash
terraform —version
```

9. Let’s start initializing our project by running the following command:

```bash
terraform init
```

The command above will download all the public modules and the files needed by the AWS Terraform provider. If you get a message containing this `Terraform has been successfully initialized!` then you are all set. Otherwise, you will get the exact error, maybe a typo or something out of place, that you need to fix. 

10. Now we are going to test our configuration:

```bash
terraform plan
```

The command above will return a summary of all the things that will be added, changed, or destroyed. This will give us a very good idea of how is everything working before proceeding.

```bash
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource
actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create
 <= read (data resources)

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # data.aws_eks_cluster.cluster will be read during apply
  # (config refers to values not yet known)
 <= data "aws_eks_cluster" "cluster"  {
      + arn                       = (known after apply)
      + certificate_authority     = (known after apply)
      + created_at                = (known after apply)
      + enabled_cluster_log_types = (known after apply)
      + endpoint                  = (known after apply)
      + id                        = (known after apply)
      + identity                  = (known after apply)
      + kubernetes_network_config = (known after apply)
      + name                      = (known after apply)
      + platform_version          = (known after apply)
      + role_arn                  = (known after apply)
      + status                    = (known after apply)
      + tags                      = (known after apply)
      + version                   = (known after apply)
      + vpc_config                = (known after apply)
    }

  #,

**Plan: 50 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:
  + cluster_endpoint          = (known after apply)
  + cluster_id                = (known after apply)

  + cluster_security_group_id = (known after apply)
  + config_map_aws_auth       = [

          + binary_data = null
          + data        = (known after apply)
          + id          = (known after apply)
          + metadata    = [

                  + annotations      = null
                  + generate_name    = null
                  + generation       = (known after apply)
                  + labels           = {
                      + "app.kubernetes.io/managed-by" = "Terraform"
                      + "terraform.io/module"          = "terraform-aws-modules.eks.aws"
                    }
                  + name             = "aws-auth"
                  + namespace        = "kube-system"
                  + resource_version = (known after apply)
                  + uid              = (known after apply)
                },
            ]
        },
    ]
  + kubectl_config            = (known after apply)
  + region                    = "us-east-1"

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take
exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply"
```

11. Now that we are sure about what our project does, we are going to apply the changes by running the command below. You will be asked to confirm the changes by typing “yes”.

```bash
terraform apply
```

If you get a timeout when applying changes, just try again. It may be the chosen instance type at allocation time or a connection error from your terminal.

This process is going to take around 15-20 minutes, but depending on your own configuration it can be significantly more or less. Please remember that your terminal needs to be accessible and connected to the internet until the command finishes running. Once it is done, you are going to get the following message: 
    `Apply complete! Resources: 50 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.`

12. Next, we are going to extract all the outputs that we configured on the `outputs.tf` file. Those are also part of the confirmation message that you get below the “Apply complete!" Those variables will be used to construct our `kubeconfig` file. To extract those values, we are going to use the following command:

```bash
aws eks --region $(terraform output -raw region) update-kubeconfig --name $(terraform output -raw cluster_name)
```

13. We are all set! Now let’s confirm that the cluster is created.

```bash
aws eks list-clusters
```

If everything worked as expected you will get a similar output:

```json
{"clusters": ["picturesocial-129"]}
```

14. If you have experience with Kubernetes and you already have a workload to test, feel free to start playing. But if you don’t know how to deploy an application I suggest you to delete all this infrastructure and redeploy it when the next post arrives 😀 You can do it by running this command:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

Wow! This was long for a blog post, but you made it! You can reuse this template to create your own clusters and even to create your own modules in the future. The [next post](/posts/picturesocial/04-how-to-deploy-an-app-to-kubernetes/) will be about how to deploy an application to Kubernetes and I believe it is one of the most satisfactory parts of this series because this is when you see your application finally running in Kubernetes and taking advantage of capabilities as self-healing, auto scaling, load balancing, etc. Also, if you want to learn more about Terraform modules for EKS, I suggest you to jump to the [Amazon EKS Blueprints for Terraform](https://aws-ia.github.io/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints/) that contains lots of great modules, available to use for your production ready Kubernetes deployment.

I hope you learned something reading this post and I look forward to learn together on the [next one](/posts/picturesocial/04-how-to-deploy-an-app-to-kubernetes/).
