> "Everything fails all of the time." — Werner Vogels, AWS CTO

That's not what Swifties wanted to hear as they tried to buy tickets to Taylor Swift's Eras tour. But as fans coordinated purchases with spreadsheets, multiple browser windows, and group text threads, only to be denied, it started to feel like a Cruel Summer. 

Most people don't understand the impact of a system failure until they experience it themselves: you can't just Shake It Off. This post has articles, news, and events to help you prepare because, if there’s one thing we know All Too Well, it's that failure happens.

## Resilience: Compiled

1. What do big trucks, Jackie Chan movies, and cardboard boxes have in common? **Read about resilience** from AWS Developer Advocate Seth Eliot as he explains [how Amazon.com does DevOps in real life](https://community.aws/posts/how-amazon-does-devops-in-real-life).
2. **Gain confidence and improve the resilience of your application** with AWS Developer Advocates Seth Eliot, Brian Ketelsen, and Linda Haviv as they [use Chaos Engineering to learn how a software system recovers (or doesn't)](https://community.aws/livestreams/winging-it/2023-05-24).
3. Do you know where your backups are? **Learn where to put your backups** and what data recovery looks like for different failure modes from AWS Solutions Architect Jennifer Moran in her [latest blog post](https://community.aws/posts/where-do-i-put-my-backups-in-the-cloud).
4. What happened to my car?! No, we didn’t forget where we parked at the concert. **Read about gray failures** from AWS Solutions Architect Clark Richey as he shares [how his stalling car helped him understand these tricky failures](https://community.aws/posts/what-happened-to-my-car).
5. Compliance requirements, resiliency, or latency may be reasons you want to **implement a multi-region system**. AWS Community Builder Jimmy Dahlqvist shows you [how to do this for your IoT system](https://community.aws/posts/building-a-multi-region-serverless-iot-system).

## Community buzz
