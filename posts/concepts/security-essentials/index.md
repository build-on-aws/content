## Introduction

## What is cloud security?

## What is Shared Responsibility?
Security and Compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer. By following this shared model, customers can reduce the operational burden as AWS assumes responsability for operating, managing, and controlling the components "of the cloud."  This leaves customers to do what they do best, and implement their services assuming responsability of securing those services "in the cloud."
