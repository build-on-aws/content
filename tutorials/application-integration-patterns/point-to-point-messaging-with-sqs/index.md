## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, you will need the following:

- AWS Account: If you don't have one, you can [sign up for free](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/guides/setup-environment/?sc_channel=el&sc_campaign=appswave&sc_geo=mult&sc_country=mult&sc_outcome=acq). The AWS Free Tier gives you plenty of resources to play around with, including AWS Lambda and Amazon SQS, which is what we will be using.
- The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK): [How to setup and bootstrap the AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/guides/setup-cdk/?sc_channel=el&sc_campaign=appswave&sc_geo=mult&sc_country=mult&sc_outcome=acq)

## Introduction






Let's learn by example.

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the creation of a basic application with a point-to-point messaging channel between two Lambda functions using Amazon SQS.

You will build the application using TypeSript and the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK).

The application will consist of three components:
- A *producer* that can send messages to a consumer
- A *consumer* that can receive messages from a producer
- A *message queue* establishing the communication channel between the producer and the consumer

## Prerequisites

We'll assume you already have an [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/free), the [AWS CLI installed and set up](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html), and the [AWS CDK installed](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/guides/setup-cdk/module-two/).

This tutorial requires at least version 2 of the AWS CLI and AWS CDK. You can tell the version of both by running the following commands in a shell prompt (indicated by the $ prefix):

```bash
$ aws --version
aws-cli/2.xx.xx ...

$ cdk --version
2.xx.xx ...
```

If the CLI and CDK are installed, you should see the respective versions of your installations. If it isn't, you'll get an error telling you that the command can't be found.

## Creating a project

First, you'll have to take care of some initial setup. Namely, you'll need to auto-generate some code that establishes a CDK project.

From the command line create an empty directory where you'd like to store your code:

```bash
$ mkdir point-to-point-example && cd point-to-point-example
```

Inside this directory, run the following command:

```bash
$ cdk init app --language typescript
```

This will create few directories and some configuration files containing CDK-specific options and application-specific settings.

Now is a good time to open the project in your favorite IDE and have a look at the following two files:

- `lib\point-to-point-example-stack.ts` is where your CDK application‚Äôs main stack is defined. This is the file we‚Äôll be spending most of our time in.
- `bin\point-to-point-example.ts` is the entrypoint of the CDK application. It will load the stack defined in `lib\point-to-point-example-stack.ts`. In this tutorial we won‚Äôt need to look at this file anymore.

## The main stack

Open up `lib\point-to-point-example-stack.ts`. This is where we will define the infratsructure needed for our application:

```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
// import * as sqs from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-sqs';

export class PointToPointExampleStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // The code that defines your stack goes here
    // ...
  }
}
```

As you can see, our app was created with an empty CDK stack (`PointToPointExampleStack`).

## Bootstrapping an environment

The first time you deploy an AWS CDK app into an environment (account/region), you need to bootstrap your AWS accountwith a **CDKToolkit** stack. This stack includes resources that are used by the CDK. For example, the stack includes an S3 bucket that is used to store templates and assets during the deployment process.

You can use the `cdk bootstrap` command to install the bootstrap stack into an environment:

```bash
$ cdk bootstrap
```

This will take some time and will be completed once you see the following output on your command line:

```bash
‚úÖ  Environment aws://[account_id]/[region] bootstrapped.
```

## Let's deploy

Change into the `point-to-point-example` directory, if you haven't already, and run the following command to deploy the CDK app:

```bash
$ cdk deploy
```

This will take some time and will be completed once you see something similar to the following output on your command line:

```bash
...

‚úÖ  SqsTutorialStack

‚ú®  Deployment time: 11.96s

Stack ARN:
arn:aws:cloudformation:[region]:[account_id]:stack/SqsTutorialStack/...

‚ú®  Total time: 16.13s
```

## Creating the SQS queue

Now that your environment is set up, you can start creating the first resource for your app: An Amazon SQS queue.

Open the file lib\point-to-point-example-stack.ts. 

You can see that the CDK template has already added a few import statements, including `aws-cdk-lib/aws-sqs` in a comment. This is convenient, as we don't have to add it manually anymore.

Remove the comment symbols `//` in front of the `import` line so that the first three lines of the file look like this:

```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import * as sqs from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-sqs';
```

Now remove the comments below the statement `super(scope, id, props)` and replace them with the following code:

```typescript
const queue = new sqs.Queue(this, 'Queue', {
  queueName: 'MyQueue',
});
```

Save the file and deploy the application using the following command:

```bash
$ cdk deploy
```

This will create an SQS queue, which is our first real AWS resource, and can take a minute or so to complete.

Once the deployment has finished, navigate to your [list of SQS queues](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sqs/v2/home#/queues) in the AWS Management Console and find the queue named  **SqsTutorialStack-Queue...**:

## Lambda

```typescript
import * as lambda from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda';
```

```bash
mkdir lambda-src
mkdir lambda-src/producer
touch lambda-src/producer/send_message_to_sqs.js
```

```typescript
import * as iam from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-iam';
```
