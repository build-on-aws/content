## What We're Looking For

### Who Writes on Community.aws

We are looking for people with technical knowledge to write about their experiences, share their opinions, and help others in the community. We publish content from authors who want to share their challenges (and helpful hints) to learning a programming language, a dive deep into why it's always DNS, best practices on building microservices architectures, and more.

### What Topics We’re Looking For

Content may be about programming languages (JavaScript, C#, Python, C#, etc), address generic topics about a category (compute, database, machine learning, networking, cloud) or a particular technology (Docker, Javascript, BGP, TLS1.3), or help a builder solve a problem they are facing.

Not sure what to write about? Check out our idea backlog [here](https://github.com/build-on-aws/content/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).

## Writing style

Content is original and has a friendly style. Our content reviewers will help you make sure your content is in this style so you can build trust and rapport with the technical community.

## Republishing content from other platforms

We are accepting limited republishing requests for content from other platforms at this time, please submit [a request](LINK TBD) to republish. Please note that you need to be the original author for the content piece, and if accepted, we will set up a canonical link for the content piece to point to the original location as the source of truth.

### Be You

Content published comes from you, a human, not you, a company. Content that comes from a human will build trust and be more authentic than content that comes from a brand and goes through a PR review. This content will incorporate your personal stories and experiences. Our editorial process focusses on helping you improve the quality of your piece, and not reshaping it.

### Conversational

Our content is conversational, as if you were explaining technical topics to your friend or a colleague.

### Have an Opinion

Share your opinions and back it up with sound reasoning. Not only will this build trust with the reader, but it will help readers make decisions that work best for their situation. It’s okay to say, “I would start with Fargate because X, Y, Z” or “Are you sure you need containers right now?”. Don’t give non-answers like “EKS, ECS, and Fargate all have their strengths and weaknesses” because that is not helpful to the reader.

### Educational and Useful

Readers are looking for content that helps them solve a problem. Your number one job is to help the reader, by providing expert guidance, backed by strong reasoning and a deep understanding of the problem.

### Clear and Concise

Content is focused and doesn't ramble. Each word, each sentence is necessary to get your point across. You choose words that are simple, not clever and avoid cultural idioms. Complex ideas are explained clearly and concisely, using images, illustrations, and examples to get the point across.

### What It Isn't

The content is not your traditional marketing content. It doesn't try to sell readers a product or service and it's not clickbait. Calls-to-action are allowed but content doesn't prioritize them over helping the reader solve a problem.

## Publishing Process
On 28 November 2023, we launched the new Post Editor that allows authoring directly in the browser on [community.aws](https://community.aws).

## The Legal Details

### What's Allowed and What's Not Allowed

We want this to be the best place for hands-on builders to learn about a technology or solve a problem or to contribute content to share their knowledge and help others. If you're trying to market or sell a solution, self-promote, or disparage a person, company, or community not only will it not resonate with readers, but your content will not be published.
