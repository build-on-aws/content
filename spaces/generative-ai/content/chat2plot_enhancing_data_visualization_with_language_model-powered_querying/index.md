title: "Chat2Plot: Enhancing Data Visualization with Language Model-Powered Querying"
description: "In todayâ€™s data-driven world, the ability to quickly and effectively visualize data is crucial for making informed decisions. Data analysts and scientists often rely on SQL queries to extract relevant information from databases. However, writing complex SQL queries can be a daunting task for non-technical users, leading to a disconnect between data access and data visualization. Enter Chat2Plot, a revolutionary approach that leverages the power of Language Model-Powered Querying (LLM) to bridge this gap. In this blog, we explore what LLM is, how it enables Prompt to SQL conversion, and how it can connect with different databases to fetch data for seamless data visualization."
