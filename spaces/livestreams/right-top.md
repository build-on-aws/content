#### Stream with us

Have you built something interesting recently that you‚Äôd like to show the world about? Have you solved some niche, yet critical, aspect of the entire workflow for foundation models on AWS? Did you write a cool program to generate millions of images or anything in-between?

Join us as a guest speaker on our weekly Twitch show, [Build on Generative AI](https://community.aws/livestreams/build-on-generative-ai). Every Monday at 9am PST / 12pm EST / 5pm BST we cover new angles about foundation models on AWS. Last season, available here, covered 20+ topics across the entire lifecycle.
