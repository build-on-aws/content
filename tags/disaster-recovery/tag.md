[Disaster recovery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/disaster-recovery-workloads-on-aws/disaster-recovery-workloads-on-aws.html) is the process of preparing for and recovering from a disaster. An event that prevents a workload or system from fulfilling its business objectives in its primary deployed location is considered a disaster.
