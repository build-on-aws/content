Observability is the ability to understand a system's internal state by examining its external outputs, such as logs, metrics, and traces. It's crucial for monitoring, diagnosing, and improving software performance and reliability. By implementing observability practices, engineers can proactively identify issues and optimize systems to maintain overall health and stability.
