## Markdown Syntax

### Where do I find the general Markdown syntax guide?

üëâ [https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

### I have a series of posts. How do I link them together?

Currently, there is no built-in support for a series of posts, however you can accomplish this using simple [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). Example:

```text
This is a 3-part series:
1. What is broken access control? (this post)
1. [What is a cryptographic failure?](/posts/owasp-top-10-defined/02-what-is-a-cryptographic-failure/)
1. [What is an injection attack?](/posts/owasp-top-10-defined/03-what-is-an-injection-attack/)
```

_Note: Add a trailing slash at the end._

You can then structure the layout of your files like this:

```text
posts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ owasp-top-10-defined
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01-what-is-broken-access-control
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ broken-access-control.png
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02-what-is-a-cryptographic-failure
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cryptographic-failure.png
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 03-what-is-an-injection-attack
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ what-is-an-injection-attack.png
```

Where `posts/owasp-top-10-defined/01-what-is-broken-access-control/index.md` is part 1, `posts/owasp-top-10-defined/02-what-is-a-cryptographic-failure/index.md` is part 2, and `posts/owasp-top-10-defined/03-what-is-an-injection-attack/index.md` is part 3.

The resulting URL mapping will be:

* https://buildon.aws/posts/owasp-top-10-defined/01-what-is-broken-access-control/
* https://buildon.aws/posts/owasp-top-10-defined/02-what-is-a-cryptographic-failure/
* https://buildon.aws/posts/owasp-top-10-defined/03-what-is-an-injection-attack/

You can see an example of this in the repo [here](/posts/owasp-top-10-defined).

### How do I link to other posts in my series or other posts on the BuildOn.AWS site?

You can reference them using absolute paths like this, but **omit the `.md`** as we turn the markdown into an HTML document:

* `[What is a cryptographic failure?](/posts/owasp-top-10-defined/02-what-is-a-cryptographic-failure/)`
* `[A cool tutorial](/tutorials/a-cool-tutorial/)`

_**Note:** Please do not hard code the full URL in the post_

### How do I create a Table of Contents for my post?

If your post contains several chapters and they have titles, you can embed a table of contents which will dynamically display and link to the existing titles. Simply insert a markdown table with one column, make the first row of the table a title and place the word "ToC" in the first cell. Notice the capitalization of the keyword ToC, which has to be respected.

````markdown
| ToC |
|-----|
````

The Table of Contents can be placed anywhere in the article, and will render links to any titles found after its own position. So, it is possible to place it at the very beginning of the post, or perhaps in some cases there are some introductory paragraphs and the ToC goes right after, linking to the rest of the article. Both options are possible. You can also specify your own content manually for the ToC, simply adding rows to the ToC table. It will render them instead of the autodetected titles:

````markdown
| ToC                                                                                                                          |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| My custom Table Of Contents                                                                                                  | 
| 1. [Introduction](#introduction)                                                                                             |
| &nbsp; 1.1 [Getting started with the existing code](#getting-started-with-the-existing-code)                                 |
| &nbsp; 1.2 [Automatic instrumentation with the OpenTelemetry agent](#automatic-instrumentation-with-the-opentelemetry-agent) |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.2.1 [Sending telemetry data to the collector](#sending-telemetry-data-to-the-collector)                      |
| 2. [Sending all the traces to Grafana Tempo](#sending-all-the-traces-to-grafana-tempo)                                       |
| &nbsp; 2.1 [Manual instrumentation with the OpenTelemetry SDK](#manual-instrumentation-with-the-opentelemetry-sdk)           |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.1.1 [Custom metrics with the OpenTelemetry SDK](#custom-metrics-with-the-opentelemetry-sdk)                  |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.1.1.1 [Sending all the metrics to Prometheus](#sending-all-the-metrics-to-prometheus)                 |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.1.2 [Bonus: switching the observability backend to AWS](#bonus-switching-the-observability-backend-to-aws)   |
 ````

Notice that standard Markdown syntax only allows text, links, and simple formatting inside a table, not complex structures such as lists. In this example we use `&nbsp;` (a whitespace character in HTML) to emulate indentation for the custom ToC content.

This is how this table of contents may look like when inserted in an article:

![Manual Table of Contents in an article](Manual-ToC.webp)

### How do I specify article attributes, such as the time to read it, complexity, prerequisites, etc?

Insert a table with two columns, and make the first row in the header contain the word "Attributes" in the first cell and leave the second cell empty. Then specify attribute names and values in the body of the table. For example, you can copy this table as a template (if you need to provide multiple items in a cell, take a look at the `Requires` value column for how to do this):

```markdown
| Attributes             |                                                        |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚úÖ AWS experience       | Beginner                                               |

```

Table cells can contain simple texts with basic formatting (such as bold or italic), links, emojis (either directly or using their unicode representation), etc.

This table can be placed anywhere in the article, although it usually makes more sense to have it at the very beginning. There could be cases where it fits better after some introductory content.

This is how the attributes table renders on a desktop browser in an article. At the bottom, you can see an auto-generated Table of Contents placed after some introductory paragraph.

### How do I show images in my post?

Store your images (jpg, png, webp, svg, gif) in an `images` subdirectory of your post.

```text
posts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ what-happens-when-you-type-a-url-in-your-browser
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ the-internet.jpg
```

_**Note:** Do not share images across posts or even posts in a series._

To show images in your post, you'll link to them using a relative path:

`![Put your alt-text here](images/the-internet.jpg) "Put your image title/caption here"`

The caption will appear underneath the image and also on mouse over.

### How do I show videos in my post?

At the moment, only YouTube videos are supported. Simply place the URL of the video in a separate line, for example:

```text
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor.
```

The video will be embedded in the article with a responsive layout that adjusts to the available width.

![Video embedded in an article](embedded-video.webp "Video embedded in an article")

It works with the domains `youtube.com`, `youtu.be` or `youtube-nocookie.com`.

### How do I get syntax highlighting in my code snippets?

Use standard markdown code blocks, and specify the language, for example:

````markdown
   ```javascript
   console.log("Hello World!");
   ```
````

This will render something like:

![Example of code snippet with syntax highlighting](code-snippet-highlighting.webp "Example of code snippet with syntax highlighting")

If you do not specify a language, autodetection takes place. Although it works reasonably in many cases, this system is not perfect, so we recommend explicitly indicating the language in order to get consistent results. If you want to disable language autodetection in a code snippet, simply specify "text" or "plaintext" language. This is particularly useful for embedding the output of some command.

### What languages does syntax highlighting support?

Currently, the following languages are supported:

* bash (or sh)
* clojure
* cpp (or c++)
* csharp (or c#)
* css
* dockerfile (or docker)
* fsharp (or f#)
* go
* java
* javascript
* json
* kotlin
* php
* plaintext
* powershell
* python
* ruby
* shell
* swift
* typescript
* xml
* yaml (or yml)
* html
* sh
* text (or plaintext). This one actually disables highlighting preventing incorrect guessing.

### How do I write the same code snippet in different languages?

If you want embed the same code snippet in different languages, for example, explaining how to do some algorithm in Java, Python, Javascript, etc., put them in a list. The list must contain in all its elements a small piece of text (the title) and a code snippet, for example:

````markdown
* Javascript
    ```javascript
    console.log("Hello world");
    ```
* Java
    ```java
    System.out.println("Hello world");
    ```
* Python
    ```python
    print("Hello world")
    ```
* Linux bash
    ```sh
    echo "Hello world"
    ```
````

This will be rendered as one single code block with different tabs on the top for the different code snippets. The title of each tab will be the text in every list item. Notice that if any of the list elements does not respect this format, the whole list will be rendered as a normal list.

![Example of a code snippet in different languages, rendered with tabs](code-snippet-tabs.webp "Example of a code snippet in different languages, rendered with tabs")

If you don't want a list of code snippets to be rendered as tabs, simply separate with an empty line every list element. Actually, if any of the list elements contains anything different to a text + a code snippet (like in the example above), it will not be rendered with tabs.

### How do I embed a Mermaid diagram in my article?

Simply use a code snippet specifying the language as _mermaid_. For example:

````markdown  
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```
````

will render something like:

![An example of a mermaid diagram](mermaid-diagram.webp "An example of a mermaid diagram")

Refer to the [mermaid page](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) for examples and language syntax.

### How do I embed mathematical formulas or equations in my articles?

You can embed inline formulas inside a paragraph by escaping it with `$...$`. For blocks that display standalone, centered in the screen, either enclose them with `$$...$$` or use a regular code snippet with language _math_.

For example, a content like this:

````markdown
To evaluate a model we use an error measure that uses some topological distance mechanism on the output manifold to measure distance of a prediction to an observed value or $\mathcal{E} = \lVert p-o \rVert$, where $p$ is a predicted value and $o$ is an observed value. For instance RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) is a type of distance in a multi-dimensional space.

$$RMSE = \sqrt{{\frac{1}{n}} \sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-x_i)^2 }$$
````

will render something like this:
![An example of some math formulas](math-formulas.webp "An example of some math formulas")

Refer to the [MathJax basic tutorial](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) for details on the syntax to write your formulas.

### How do I show content under tabs?
Code snippets in different languages can be grouped under tabs, like we saw above. But it is not the only content that can be displayed under tabs. Other possible elements include:
* Mermaid diagrams (which are a type of code snippet with language `mermaid`).
* Math formulas (when they are represented as code snippets with language `math`).
* Images. Notice in this case images do not support captions.

Mermaid diagrams and math formulas use the same syntax as code snippets in different languages ([see above](#how-do-i-write-the-same-code-snippet-in-different-languages)), since they are a particular type of code snippet.
Images inside tabs use a similar syntax. You just need to create a markdown list where each element consists on a text (which will be used for the tab title) followed by an image, for example:

````markdown 
* Image 1
  ![Image 1 title](https://domain.com/aaa.png)
* Image 2
  ![Image 2 title](https://domain.com/bbb.png)
* Image 3
  ![Image 3 title](https://domain.com/ccc.png)
````
